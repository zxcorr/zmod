# beam-zernike-fit
This program contains functions that are suited for performing
a fit of the beam data produced by GRASP, more specifically, it
takes data from a .grd file and finds the Zernike coefficients
for this set of values.
There are also auxiliary functions to plot data from dual cut files.

The main function to be used for the fitting is multifile_zernike().
