# zmod
This program contains functions that are suited for performing
a fit of the beam pattern data produced by GRASP, more specifically, 
it takes data from a .grd file and finds the Zernike coefficients
for this set of values, although it might be flexible enough to
be used as a general beam pattern data analyser.

The main objects to be used are the classes contained in the
submodule zmod.zernike_class.
